Feature: SnpTk Map Using RS Id

    Given a PLINK extended MAP file (.bim) (https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats#bim)

    Read in:
    - test.bim
    - dbsnp.gz
    - rsmerge.gz

    Write out:
    - updated_snps.txt - Variant ids that should be updated (variant id, new variant id) (uses rsmerge)
    - deleted_snps.txt - Variant ids that should be removed (variant id) (uses dbsnp)
    - coord_update.txt - Updated coordinates (variant id, coordinate) (uses dbsnp)
    - chr_update.txt - Updated chromosome (variant id, chromosome) (uses dbsnp)
